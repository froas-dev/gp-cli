# pycom

**pycom** is a simple CLI tool for instantly running `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, and `git push` with a single command.

---

## 🚀 Usage

From any git repository, simply run:

```bash
pycom "your commit message"
```

The tool will:
- Stage all changes (`git add .`)
- Commit with your message
- Push to the current branch

---

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone this repository and install locally:

```bash
pip install .
```

Or, if published on PyPI:

```bash
pip install pycom
```

---

## 💡 Why?

Typing `git add . && git commit -m "" && git push` every time is boring!  
Use `pycom` for one-shot commits to speed up your workflow.
